# OPES Expanded Target
A Unified Approach to Enhanced Sampling - https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03055

This repository contains all the input files and scripts needed to reproduce the results of the paper, and all the data used to produce the figures.

The software used is PLUMED 2.6, GROMACS 2018.4, and LAMMPS (7 Aug 2019)

The OPES code is still a beta version, we will provide it as a PLUMED module using a different syntax.
